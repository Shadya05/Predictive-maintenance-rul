# Predictive Maintenance – Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **predictive maintenance** by estimating the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan jet engines using sensor and operating condition data.  
The goal is to predict how many operational cycles an engine can continue before failure, enabling timely maintenance and preventing unexpected breakdowns.

The project is built step by step, starting from data understanding and feature engineering to baseline model evaluation, following a **professional machine learning workflow**.

---

## Problem Statement
Aircraft engines degrade over time due to continuous operation.  
Using historical sensor data, this project aims to:

- Model engine degradation behavior
- Predict the remaining number of cycles before failure (RUL)
- Validate whether engine condition snapshots can be used to estimate RUL

This is formulated as a **supervised regression problem**, where the target variable is numerical.

## Dataset
**NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Degradation Dataset (FD001)**

### Files Used So Far
- `train_FD001.txt`  
  Contains full run-to-failure data for multiple engines.  
  This file is used to compute true RUL values and train models.

### Dataset Characteristics
- Multiple engines
- Each engine runs for several cycles until failure
- Each cycle contains:
  - Engine ID
  - Cycle number
  - 3 operating settings
  - 21 sensor readings

---

## Project Approach (So Far)

### 1. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Loaded raw text data using pandas
- Assigned meaningful column names
- Understood engine-cycle structure
- Treated each engine-cycle row as a **snapshot** of engine condition

---

### 2. RUL Target Creation
Since the dataset does not directly provide RUL for training data:

- For each engine, the last cycle represents failure
- RUL was computed as:

### 2. RUL Target Creation
Since the dataset does not directly provide RUL for training data:

- For each engine, the last cycle represents failure
- RUL was computed as:
    RUL = max_cycle_of_engine − current_cycle


This created a labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning.

---

### 3. Feature Engineering
#### Sensor Analysis
- Visualized sensor behavior across cycles
- Identified sensors showing **consistent degradation patterns**
- Avoided using all sensors to reduce noise

#### Selected Features
- 5 degradation-relevant sensors (based on visualization)
- 3 operating settings

These were combined to form the **feature matrix (X)**.

---

### 4. Feature Matrix and Target Variable
- **X (features):**
  - Selected sensors
  - Operating settings
- **y (target):**
  - Remaining Useful Life (RUL)

Each row in X corresponds to one engine snapshot, and each value in y represents its true remaining life.

---

### 5. Train–Test Split
- Split data into:
  - 80% training data
  - 20% testing data
- Ensured no data leakage
- Maintained alignment between X and y

---

### 6. Baseline Model – Linear Regression
A **Linear Regression model** was trained as a baseline to validate learnability.

**Why Linear Regression?**
- Simple and interpretable
- Helps verify whether engineered features contain predictive signal
- Acts as a reference point before using complex models

---

### 7. Model Evaluation
Predictions were made on unseen test data and evaluated using:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
  Average prediction error in cycles

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
  Penalizes large prediction errors

#### Results
- MAE ≈ **35 cycles**
- RMSE ≈ **45 cycles**

**Interpretation:**
- The model learns meaningful patterns
- Linear assumptions are insufficient for precise RUL estimation
- Indicates the need for non-linear models

---

## Current Status
✔ Data prepared and labeled  
✔ Feature engineering completed  
✔ Baseline model trained and evaluated  
✔ Learning signal validated  

---

## Next Steps
- Train non-linear models (e.g., XGBoost)
- Compare performance against baseline
- Select final model
- Save trained model
- Deploy model as an API using cloud services

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## Key Learning Outcomes So Far
- Understanding of predictive maintenance problems
- Snapshot-based modeling for time-dependent systems
- Feature selection through data visualization
- Importance of baseline models
- Proper use of regression metrics (MAE, RMSE)
